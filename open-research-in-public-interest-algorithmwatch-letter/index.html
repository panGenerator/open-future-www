<h1>Open research in the public interest: Use the DSA to Stop Platforms from Suppressing Public Interest Research</h1>
<div class=w-100></div>
<div class=date>September 7, 2021 </div>
<div class="pt-3 pb-1"><p>On the 1st of September, we signed an <a href=https://algorithmwatch.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Open_Letter_to_European_Lawmakers_01.09.21-latest.pdf>open letter</a> to European Lawmakers written by <a href=https://algorithmwatch.org/en/>AlgorithmWatch</a>. The letter calls on the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers to make use of the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=COM:2020:825:FIN">Digital Services Act</a> to prevent online platforms from hindering ongoing public interest research about them. The letter has been signed by 35 civil society and scientific organisations, and 6126 individuals.</p>
<p>This request arises following Facebook’s continuous actions to block researchers from accessing data about its operations. The letter was triggered by the recent shutdown of AlgorithmWatch’s <a href=https://algorithmwatch.org/en/monitoring-instagram/>Instagram monitoring project</a>. And this is not an isolated case. Recently, Mozilla Foundation <a href=https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/news/why-facebooks-claims-about-the-ad-observer-are-wrong/>shared news</a> of Facebook blocking in a similar manner its Ad Observer project.</p>
<p>Such disproportionate actions urgently require not only a society-wide debate about the role online platforms play in the online sphere, but also regulatory interventions. Policymakers need to ensure that platforms conduct activities in a transparent manner and are therefore accountable to the public.</p>
<p>The current status quo, where information is increasingly commodified and owned by a handful of established market players, significantly restricts the ability of civil society organizations and researchers to study platforms and exercise their watchdog function in the name of the general public.</p>
<p>The DSA constitutes a crucial opportunity to ensure that platform data is available for public interest research in the name of transparency and openness. Also, it is a step towards general data interoperability requirements that serve to make data collected by platforms, and data on their functioning, more freely available. As such, it is an element of a policy that transforms the digital environment from one dominated by close platforms to one based on principles of <a href=http://sdeps.eu/>public space</a>.</p>

<p>Please support the letter, to put pressure on European lawmakers and prevent similar episodes from happening in the future. Organisations can sign by writing to <a href=mailto:policy@algorithmwatch.org>AlgorithmWatch</a>. Today, it is the European lawmakers who have the upper hand in determining platforms’ accountability towards the public. Yet, they will only do so with a vibrant community supporting such actions.</p>
