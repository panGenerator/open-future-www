At Open Future we shape today’s digital policies with tomorrow’s challenges in mind. We put our knowledge and experience to work along EU institutions and civil society to ensure that the principle of openness is reflected in the European Union’s digital policy framework.

We believe that Europe has a mission to keep the internet open and make it better. To rebuild it, so that it is a place governed by equal opportunities, democratic access to information and respect for fundamental rights. A public space built on the idea of the commons. We work on advancing Digital Public Spaces, building Data Commons and designing the Future of Open. We do this by developing approaches to open that maximize the societal benefits of information resources.

We think that the current European policy environment provides a real opportunity to realise these objectives by enacting meaningful legislative change. At the same time we are also setting our sights on developing initiatives for the next European Commission to take up.
