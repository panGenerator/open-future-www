On the 1st of September, we signed [“A letter on data governance and democracy”](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/announcements/a-letter-on-data-governance-and-democracy/?mc_cid=5edb8d63cb&mc_eid=8f43b70664) published by [RadicalxChange](https://www.radicalxchange.org). The letter is directed to policymakers worldwide to propose a new vision of data governance. Instead of monopolistic ownership and data commodification, RadicalXChange advocates for a democratic and sustainable framework where data is governed collectively through data intermediaries. In the letter, the signatories call for “a new way of thinking about data” rooted in data portability and interoperability.

>*“By and large, data is not merely a personal asset to be individually owned and controlled, but a shared resource to be responsibly governed. This means we must start to move beyond the familiar individualistic mindsets of both personal property and dignitary rights – and instead start building flexible, federated, and democratically-accountable governance structures for information”.*

This initiative is aligned with our vision for the Data Commons in Europe, according to which data governance policies must foster data access and use in the public interest while protecting citizens’ fundamental right to data protection. By governing data as a common resource, it is also possible to decentralize the online ecosystem and empower public institutions in the data economy. Finally, through collective stewardship models, the Data Commons can ultimately empower users in the online sphere by enabling them to participate in social life without having to give up personal data to commercial entities. 

With our previous contributions to the [Data Governance Act](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12491-Data-sharing-in-the-EU-common-European-data-spaces-new-rules-/F1656900_en) (DGA) and the [Data Act](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13045-Data-Act-&-amended-rules-on-the-legal-protection-of-databases/F2660205_en) (DA), we began proposing policies that are rooted in the idea of the Data Commons, so as to foster the emergence of a fair data society rooted in the principles of democracy, openness and sustainability. We have explained in more detail how the Data Commons can be translated into practice with the [DGA](https://www.openfuture.eu/five-opportunities-data-commons/) and the [DA](https://www.openfuture.eu/data-act-consultation/).
